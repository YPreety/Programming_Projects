/*Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution. 
It occurs when a normal random variable has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
The normal random variable of a standard normal distribution is called a standard score or a z score.
Z = (X - u) / s
where:
Z = value on the standard normal distribution
X = value on the original distribution
u = mean of the original distribution
s = standard deviation of the original distribution

The nextGaussian() method is used to get the next random, 
Normally distributed double value with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0.*/

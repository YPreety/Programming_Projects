/*An enum can contain constants, methods etc. enum can be defined as a group of named constant.
There are two ways for making comparison of enum members:

By using == operator
By using equals() method

1. == operator never throws NullPointerException whereas .equals() method can throw NullPointerException.
2. == is responsible for type compatibility check at compile time whereas .
   equals() method will never worry about the types of both the arguments.*/
